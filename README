Shepard is a program to watch long running commands that may quit
unexpectedly. When this happens, it restarts them.

USAGE
shepherd [-d] [COMMAND [ARGUMENTS] ---]... COMMAND [ARGUMENTS]
Runs each COMMAND with ARGUMENTS in the background, restarting them when they
die for any reason.

OPTIONS
-d		Daemonize

SIGNALS
HUP		Restart all processes
KILL, INT	Kill all processes and exit

EXAMPLES
Keeping an ssh tunnel alive (requires ssh-agent to make sense)
	shepherd ssh -D 8080 somewhere
Using more than one command
	shephard something arg --- something_else arg1 arg2
